# Evol

Evol is a minor library intended to make it easy to develop evolutionary
programs. It is not necessarily specific to EP, but would work with GA
and other systems

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'evol'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install evol

## Provides

1. Population definitions
2. Generic fitness criteria
3. Replication/mutation and combination strategies


## Usage

TODO: 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## History

I started developing evolutionary programs in the late 1990's and early 2000's. After a ten year hiatus, I decided to start again. This project's goal is to provide tools that make it easy for my work. Nothing in this project is proprietary, just standard practices defined elsewhere.
